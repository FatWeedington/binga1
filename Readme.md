# Root of Projects for Programming 1 Labs

This is the common root of several projects for the lab exercises
of module BTX8041, Programming 1.

A sample JavaFX Hello World application is provided for
your convenience, as well as a sample JUnit test class.
This is a *modular* Java project. Hence, a rudimentary
`module-info.java` file is given in directory
`src/main/java/`. Adjust this file according to your
needs.
